### The Subway Challenge but with other subway systems

### Background

I was originally interested in The Subway Challenge after I was originally told of it when I went to New York City. However, what really drove me to make this was [this tweet](https://twitter.com/wendoverpro/status/1584877177023401984) by Sam from Wendover Productions/Half as Interesting/Jet Lag: The Game. I originally assumed they would be doing a subway-related season, and spent tons of time researching it. Though the season turned out not to be about the Subway Challenge, I still decided to make this anyway.
